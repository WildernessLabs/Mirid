# Mirid
Mirid is a .NET Core console application used for Meadow.Foundation driver and documentation validation, updates and reports. Mirid assumes the Meadow.Foundation repos and the Wilderness Labs documenation repo are cloned at the same level. (this could/should become a command line argument or configuration). 

This is an internal Wilderness Labs tool with minimal support, minimal documenation and a lot of room for improvement.

Currently outputs data as CSVs in the bin folder.

Work in progress
