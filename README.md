# Mirid
Mirid is a .NET Core console application used for Meadow.Foundation driver and documentation validation and report generation. 

Currently outputs data as CSVs in the bin folder.

Work in progress 

## To Use
1. Clone Meadow.Foundation
2. Clone Documentation
3. Edit paths in Program.cs (current code assumes Meadow.Foundation, Documentation and Mirid are at the same level)
4. Run app
5. Inspect .csv files in bin folder
